You, like a flower in full bloom
Everytime I talk to you, I really don't know what to do
Baby, you, you're stuck inside my head
At night when I'm in bed I think of what I could've said
You, you, you, it's everything you do, and everything I do
My girl, I do it all for you
You, you, you, it's everything you do, and everything I do
My girl, I do it all for you
